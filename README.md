- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @janz1961
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of thing :-) but as far as Github is concerned, at the moment, it is Arduino programming. I use Arduino and some related boards 
- for projects relating to my two main hobbies: model airplanes and motorbikes with custom electronics.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on janz@cadwal.nl
